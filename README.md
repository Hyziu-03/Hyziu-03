# Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

Energy Transition Ambassador, student of AGH University of Krakow and startup founder. Passionate about leveraging data science and geostatistics to drive innovation in energy and environmental protection.

ðŸ“… In 2024 I completed energy transition program over the course of 8 months discovering and understanding the practical innovations in the field of distributed energy systems. I networked with experts and specialists from this and adjacent fields.

ðŸ“… In 2023 I began various certifications at the DataCamp platform. I deepened my understanding of geospatial tools with specific interest in R, data visualization and statistics.

ðŸ“… In 2022 I started pursuing degree in geoinformatics at AGH University of Krakow at the Faculty of Geology, Geophysics and Environmental Protection. I am specializing in geostatistics, data analysis and geospatial data processing.

ðŸ“… In 2021 I co-founded and edu-tech startup focused on empowering homeschoolers. HOMIES was organizing meetups for homeschooled students. I coordinated the efforts to develop an app helping with organization and categorization of learning materials.

ðŸ‘‰ Letâ€™s explore how my expertise in geostatistics and data visualization can drive your project forward.

ðŸ‘‰ I am eager to discuss how my skills can contribute to your project. Letâ€™s collaborate and innovate together!

Look no further. I am glad to talk and see how we can collaborate and develop together! Donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
